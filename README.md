# Bluebird_Pi_v1.0
Scripts for Raspberry Pi 2 Model B that will collect video, audio, and temperature data, as well as read PIT tags on a Mini Seeed 125kHz RFID reader.


I. Basic Raspberry Pi Setup:
  A. Installing NOOBS Operating Software
    1. The Raspberry Pi (RPi) runs off of a version of Linux called Raspbian. It is very similar to the standard version of Linux but comes with a graphical user interface (GUI) that is similar to your standard desktop. Many of the RPi kits that you find online will come with a micro SD card that has NOOBS pre-installed. If you are using your own micro SD card, then you will need to format the micro SD card to FAT32 by using: https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/. You will need to download this software to format your micro SD card.
    2. Once the SD card is formatted then download NOOBS by going to: https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/noobs/ on your own computer and download NOOBS (the regular version, not the LITE version) onto your computer by clicking the Download zip button. The download will take a while (usually 10-12 min).
    Once the download is complete, extract the files and copy them to the micro SD card.
    After the files are copied put the SD card into the micro SD card slot on the RPi and plug in the peripherals (keyboard, mouse, Wifi dongle if you need it) and finaly plug in your power source to turn on the RPi.
    You will see a screen asking you to install Raspbian. Click install at the top of the screen and wait until the operating system (OS) is installed.
    Once the OS is installed you are free to play around with the RPi!
